## 📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on **data preprocessing and quality enhancement** for diabetes prediction using the **Pima Indians Diabetes dataset**.  
The objective is to clean, transform, and balance the dataset to make it suitable for reliable machine learning model training.

Through a structured data engineering workflow, missing values, class imbalance, and data inconsistencies are handled systematically, resulting in a **cleaned, normalized, and balanced dataset** ready for predictive modeling.
